# EmailSender
In this project I learnt how to create and use interfaces and how to create and manage threads. Main task was to create email sender that can send thousend emaisl in background. Sended emails are saved in database and in txt log (temp folder). User can load sended email as template, change something and send it again.
We got an list of company emails stored in db, we can simply add email recipents by clicing on checkbox.
Project supporting attachments also stored in binary field in postgress.

I was making this feature from begining, but I never finished that.
